My Job Hunter project is used for Job listing Operation. To make this Project I have used React Js With Tailwind CSS Framwork & Daiusyui. For The Authentication Part I have used Firebase.


In this Project a user can use some functionality. I am describing it Below: 

- A user can see Job Oppurtonities. 
- A user can eassily redirect to one page another by using Navbar.
- To see the particular Job Details a user need to login themselvs into our website.
- A user can manually register with email, name, photourl & password.
- After succesfull registration user can login to see the job details & apply for job also can Add Job for apply.
- A user cann't apply in his own job post & cann't apply if the deadline is over.
- After apply job user can see applied job menu & download a pdf with the summary of his applied job.
- User can also Login with their exiting google account.
