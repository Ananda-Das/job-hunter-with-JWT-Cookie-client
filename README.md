My Job Hunter project is used for Job listing Operations. To make this Project I have used React Js With Tailwind CSS Framework & Daiusyui. For The Authentication Part, I have used Firebase.


In this Project, a user can use some functionality. I am describing it Below: 

- A user can see Job opportunities. 
- A user can easily redirect from one page to another by using Navbar.
- To see the particular Job Details a user needs to log themselves to our website.
- A user can manually register with email, name, photo URL & password.
- After successful registration user can log in to see the job details & apply for the job also Add a Job to apply.
- A user can't apply for his job post & can't apply if the deadline is over.
- After applying for a job user can see the applied job menu & download a pdf with the summary of his applied job.
- User can also log in with their existing Google account.
